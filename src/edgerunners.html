        Edge runners is undoubtedly the best anime of 2022. Every time I rewatch it, the ending hits me harder than the last time. The series is pack in every single episode that always left you with a special feeling. It is the story of David and Lucy but goddamn this show do make you long for something you didn't have. It is a one of a kind experience and Crunchyroll making it the #1 anime of 2022 is the single thing correct in their anime awards.      </p>
